## About The Project

> **Give your Windows desktop a serious style upgrade.** FerroDock is a buttery-smooth, macOS-style dock that looks amazing and feels great to use. All the Mac vibes, none of the fuss.

As a Windows user passionate about customization, I found that existing tools for achieving a macOS-like appearance were often buggy, had strange dependencies, or lacked the native feel I was looking for.

FerroDock is my solution: an attempt to build a beautiful, efficient, and deeply integrated customization suite from the ground up. I chose **Rust** for its performance, memory safety, and low-level system capabilities, allowing for a tool that is both powerful and light on resources.

## Tech Stack

* **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)**: The core language for its performance and system-level control.

## Current Features & Status

This project is currently an **early-stage prototype**. My development time is balanced with university coursework and a software development mentoring scheme.

**What's working:**
* A dock-style taskbar that displays all currently running applications.
* Real-time updates: the dock automatically adds new applications when they launch and removes them when they are closed.

## Project Roadmap

The vision for FerroDock is to become a complete customization suite. Future planned features include:
* ‚úÖ **Full Dock Interactivity:** Clicking icons to focus, minimize, and launch applications.
* üé® **A Global Menu Bar:** A macOS-style menu bar at the top of the screen.
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Customization Settings:** UI for changing icon size, dock appearance, and more.
* ‚ú® **Widget Support:** A system for macOS-like desktop widgets.

This project is a long-term passion of mine, and I'm excited to continue developing it as I grow my skills in low-level systems programming with Rust.
